          <p className="destination-description">
            Charminar was built by Sultan Mohammed Quli Qutb Shah in 1591. It is
            said that this square shaped structure with four pillars and
            intricate carvings was built in honour of his wife, Bhagmati.
            However, the actual reason behind building Charminar is still not
            clear. As per a popular belief, Charminar was built to acknowledge
            the elimination of the plague which had affected the entire city
            immensely during that era. It is believed that the Sultan had prayed
            for the end of this plague with which his people were suffering.
            Hence, as the plague ended, he built the charminar as a tribute to
            Allah. The four pillars are also said to be dedicated to the first
            four caliphs of Islam.

            vast Mughal garden that encompasses nearly 17 hectares, in the Agra
            District in Uttar Pradesh. It was built by Mughal Emperor Shah Jahan
            in memory of his wife Mumtaz Mahal with construction starting in
            1632 AD and completed in 1648 AD, with the mosque, the guest house
            and the main gateway on the south, the outer courtyard and its
            cloisters were added subsequently and completed in 1653 AD. The
            existence of several historical and Quaranic inscriptions in Arabic
            script have facilitated setting the chronology of Taj Mahal. For its
